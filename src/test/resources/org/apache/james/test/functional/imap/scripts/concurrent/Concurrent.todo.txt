Simple tests:
FETCH should set the /SEEN flag, and this should be propogated to other sessions.

3.4. The server MAY allow the RENAME of a multi-accessed mailbox by
     simply changing the name attribute on the mailbox.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
4.1. Fetching of expunged messages

4.1.2 The server MAY allow the EXPUNGE of a multi-accessed mailbox,
      and on subsequent FETCH commands return FETCH responses only for
      non-expunged messages and a tagged NO.

             C2: B001 FETCH 3:5 ENVELOPE
             S2: * 3 FETCH ENVELOPE . . . (ENVELOPE info returned)
             S2: B001 NO Some of the requested messages no longer exist
### Return what you can, and send a "no": i like this.

4.2. Storing of expunged messages

4.2.1 If the ".SILENT" suffix is used, and the STORE completed
      successfully for all the non-expunged messages, the server SHOULD
      return a tagged OK.

4.2.2. If the ".SILENT" suffix is not used, and only expunged messages
       are referenced, the server SHOULD return only a tagged NO.

4.2.3. If the ".SILENT" suffix is not used, and a mixture of expunged
       and non-expunged messages are referenced, the server MAY set the
       flags and return a FETCH response for the non-expunged messages
       along with a tagged NO.
### Update what you can, and return "NO"

4.2.4. If the ".SILENT" suffix is not used, and a mixture of expunged
       and non-expunged messages are referenced, the server MAY return
       an untagged NO and not set any flags.
### Don't update anything, and return "NO"
