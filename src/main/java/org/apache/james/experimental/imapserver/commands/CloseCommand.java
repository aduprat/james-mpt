6.4.2.  CLOSE Command

   Arguments:  none

   Responses:  no specific responses for this command

   Result:     OK - close completed, now in authenticated state
               NO - close failure: no mailbox selected
               BAD - command unknown or arguments invalid

      The CLOSE command permanently removes from the currently selected
      mailbox all messages that have the \Deleted flag set, and returns
      to authenticated state from selected state.  No untagged EXPUNGE
      responses are sent.

      No messages are removed, and no error is given, if the mailbox is
      selected by an EXAMINE command or is otherwise selected read-only.

      Even if a mailbox is selected, a SELECT, EXAMINE, or LOGOUT
      command MAY be issued without previously issuing a CLOSE command.
      The SELECT, EXAMINE, and LOGOUT commands implicitly close the
      currently selected mailbox without doing an expunge.  However,
      when many messages are deleted, a CLOSE-LOGOUT or CLOSE-SELECT

      sequence is considerably faster than an EXPUNGE-LOGOUT or
      EXPUNGE-SELECT because no untagged EXPUNGE responses (which the
      client would probably ignore) are sent.

   Example:    C: A341 CLOSE
               S: A341 OK CLOSE completed
